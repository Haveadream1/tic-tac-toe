# Tic-Tac-Toe game
Online game where we can host a local party with a second player or with a bot.
We can choose and change the sign at each round, continue the game or go back to the home screen.
## Goal
The goal is to store the gameboard as an array inside an object using a little as possible of global code. All by avoiding global code, so most elements are created with JS and added to the DOM.
